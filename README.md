## üìç Overview

This service allows you to seamlessly integrate email functionalities into your applications, without the hassle of dealing directly with the complexities of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Our remarkable API enables you to send emails effortlessly using your preferred SMTP server.

---

## üì¶ Features

### Rate Limit

This service has a optinal rate limit to prevent abuse. You can make a maximum of 1 request every 30 seconds. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a response with a status of 429 (Too Many Requests) and the following `Retry-After` header indicating the time in seconds to wait before making the next request.

### Templates

Simplifies the setup of customizable email templates through Hermes APIs. With the Go templating language, users can easily include dynamic variables in their templates, ensuring adaptability for specific email content needs.

### Send emails via API

Send emails through a simple API request. The API supports the `POST /api/send-email` method and requires the following parameters in the request body (in JSON format):

```json
{
	"to": "example@tdl.com",
	"subject": "Email subject",
	"body": "Hello, hermes is awesome!"
}
```

or with template:

```json
{
	"to": "example@tdl.com",
	"subject": "Email subject",
	"templateName": "welcome",
	"content": {
		"Content": "Hello, hermes is awesome!",
		"Link": "https://github.com/mauriciofsnts/hermes"
	}
}
```

#### Response example

```json
{
	"message": "Email sent successfully"
}
```

```json
{
	"error": "Failed to send email: <error message>"
}
```

---

### Queue system

The service has a queue system to send emails asynchronously. This ensures that the API response is fast and that the email is sent in the background.

#### Kafka

To use the Kafka queue system, you need to configure the Kafka server. For that, you should set the following environment variables:

```yaml
kafka:
  enabled: true
  topic: string
  brokers:
    - kafka1:19092
```

#### Redis

To use the Redis queue system, you need to configure the Redis server. For that, you should set the following environment variables:

```yaml
redis:
  enabled: true
  topic: string
  port: 6379
  host: localhost
  password: string
```

#### Memory cache

If you prefer not to utilize Redis or Kafka, Memory cache is an alternative option. To enable Memory cache, simply set the "enabled" environment variables for both Redis and Kafka to false.
